<h1 style="text-align: center;">Platform Rising</h1>
[caption id="attachment_2049" align="aligncenter" width="450"]<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/josh-preaching-cmo-2016-1-e1474356130837.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2049" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/josh-preaching-cmo-2016-1-e1474356130837-450x264.jpg" alt="Preaching the Gospel after a film showing in the Carpathian village of Scherbovets.

When I first came to Ukraine over 15 years ago, my initial goal was to learn how to speak the Ukrainian language. I knew that if I was to effectively communicate the Gospel to people here, I needed to be able to talk.

As I began my language-learning journey, I became something of a fanatic. I immersed myself in Ukrainian culture, I spent hours a week studying, and I even avoided Americans so that I could maximize my talk time in Ukrainian. In under two years, I was fluent. I could read, I could write, I could converse, and I could preach. I had arrived! Or so I thought...

As I further developed my ministry, I ran into an unexpected frustration. Despite my ability to speak, there were surprisingly few who wanted to listen.

<strong>Audience First
</strong>If you’ve watched our <a href="http://getbiblefirst.com/training/#video-start">Bible First training videos</a>, then you are familiar with a concept we teach called “Audience First”. The basic idea is that in order to be effective in communicating a message, you first need to establish a hearing with your target audience. In social media, this is often referred to as “building a platform.”

Our world today is filled with voices competing for their turn at the mic. Everyone, it seems, has something to say, but not everyone has a platform from which to say it.

In this report, I’d like to share with you how God is blessing our platform in Ukraine and around the world.

<strong>Good and Evil: Round 2</strong>
Several years ago, we translated Good and Evil into Ukrainian. We began handing out the books at film showings, and offering free copies on our web site. Back then, things were pretty quiet. But in recent months, we have seen traffic increase dramatically such that we are now sending out 50-70 books per month!

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2051" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/english-good-and-evil-bogo-special-1-240x450.jpg" alt="english-good-and-evil-bogo-special-1" width="240" height="450" />

Just before CMO began this summer, someone posted a link to our web site on a Ukrainian/Russian “freebie” site. As a result, we got over 300 requests for Good and Evil books in less than 48 hours!

At this pace, our supply of books is fast running out, and soon it will be gone. God is clearly blessing this outreach, and for this reason, we’ve begun work on “Round 2” of our Good and Evil ministry. We are working on a completely new translation of Good and Evil and we’ll be using the latest color artwork from NGJ. If God provides the funds, we hope to do a new printing in Ukrainian next year.

<strong>Bible First Translations</strong>
Since No Greater Joy began distributing Bible First books in English, we’ve seen demand for them grow tremendously! One area that is particularly exciting is the translation of Bible First into other languages. Right now, we have Spanish and French translations in progress. There is also a possibility that a Russian translation may begin soon.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2053" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Volume-1-Cover-ES.png" alt="volume-1-cover-es" width="263" height="407" />

Meanwhile, our Bible First ministry in Ukraine is thriving as well. We continue to see an average of nearly one new student every day enrolling in the course.

In the United States, a growing number of people are using Bible First to great effect in prisons. Just a few days ago, I received an email from a brother named Steve who says, “I use the Bible First course in the prison that I minister at full time in Alabama and the inmates LOVE the course and are constantly asking me if there are more courses by Bible First.”

<strong>A Cup Overflowing</strong>
As we look towards the fall season, our ministry cup is overflowing! Our message is the same as it’s been for years, but now it seems that God is allowing it to reach even more people. In addition to the two projects I’ve mentioned above, I am continuing my weekly Bible study with Oleg, and I also have regular opportunities to preach in our church here in L’viv.

Abigail, Rebekah, and Hosanna are all progressing well in school. Kelsie is a star homeschool mommy and keeps all of us on our toes! Little Kathryn is the sunshine in our lives, toddling all over the house and making new “discoveries” every day.

<strong>It’s a Boy!</strong>
In case you missed our blog post in June, we’d like to share some exciting news! Kelsie is in her 25th week of pregnancy. And now, after four girls, God has given us our first boy! We are thrilled and grateful for His gift of life, and we’re ready to embark on this new adventure. The girls in particular are excited that they will finally have a little brother. :)

<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/its-a-boy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2055" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/its-a-boy-450x338.jpg" alt="its-a-boy" width="450" height="338" /></a>

Aside from the usual fatigue, Kelsie is doing well. Based on the latest ultrasound data, our projected due date is January 5, 2017. Please keep Kelsie and our new baby in your prayers!

<strong>How You Can Pray</strong>

  <li>Pray for those who heard the Gospel during CMO 2016.</li>

One of the most common questions I am asked as a missionary is how I would describe a “typical day on the foreign mission field”. This question always amuses me because the mission field is intrinsically atypical! During my time overseas, I’ve learned that God leads our ministry through seasons. Just when we think we’ve settled into something stable, the game changes.

For many years, our ministry kept a fairly steady back-and-forth rhythm of high-energy evangelism in the summers and lesson-writing coupled with discipleship efforts in the colder months. But while those efforts continue forward, we’ve recently seen God open a new front: translation.

Because we are English speakers ministering the Gospel amongst Ukrainians, translation has always played a significant role in what we do. For example, all of our Bible First lessons were originally written in English, and then later translated into Ukrainian.

Now, as Bible First spreads far beyond the borders of Ukraine, the need for translation work has again come to the forefront. We’re very encouraged about the progress being made, and in this report I’d like to share an update on three specific language groups.

[caption id="attachment_2067" align="alignleft" width="98"]<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_1007a.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2067" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_1007a-98x100.jpg" alt="Anatoliy Zhylavyi" width="98" height="100" /></a> Anatoliy Zhylavyi[/caption]

<strong>Ukrainian</strong>
Back in the mid-2000’s, the very first language group to receive a translation of Bible First was Ukrainian. Later, we implemented significant improvements to our English lessons, but many of these were never incorporated back into the earlier Ukrainian lessons.

This fall, we hired Anatoliy Zhylaviy, a Ukrainian translator and philologist from our church, to begin a complete revision of our Ukrainian Bible First course. He is working through the entire course: editing, revising, and even retranslating as needed. Demand for Bible First amongst Ukrainians remains strong, and we are excited to bring these updated lessons to our students.

[caption id="attachment_2068" align="alignleft" width="100"]<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_3244.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2068" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_3244-100x75.jpg" alt="Catherine Leavitt" width="100" height="75" /></a> Catherine Leavitt[/caption]

<strong>French</strong>
Meet Catherine Leavitt - a French national who has spent more than two decades living in Oregon. Catherine contacted us several months ago with a desire to translate Bible First into French. She’s been working diligently on the project and is making good progress. Her father, a French linguist who still lives in France, is assisting her as well. We are very grateful to their family, and we’re looking forward to making Bible First available as a ministry tool for believers in France!

[caption id="attachment_2069" align="alignleft" width="100"]<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mail_image_preview.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2069" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mail_image_preview-100x75.png" alt="Maria Sanchez" width="100" height="75" /></a> Maria Sanchez[/caption]

<strong>Spanish</strong>
Several months ago, we received an email from a lady named Maria Sanchez. Maria uses Bible First in prison ministry, and because many of the inmates only speak Spanish, she asked if Bible First was available in that language. Upon learning that it was not, she asked for permission to translate it herself. Kelsie is also a Spanish speaker (she formerly translated for Voice of the Martyrs), and after reviewing a sample of Maria’s work, we gave her the green light.

Over the past several months, Maria has kept us on our toes as she has sent email after email with new drafts, questions, corrections, and more. She has now completed translating up through Lesson 9 - almost halfway!

<strong>The Language of the Web</strong>
As our Ukrainian, French and Spanish translators work to make Bible First available to those respective language groups, another effort is moving forward to make sure that these translations will enjoy the far-reaching scope of the World Wide Web. For some time now, we have been building a web-based application that will serve as a digital platform for Bible First. This app will allow churches and missionaries to reach people with Bible First over electronic media.

As of this writing, we estimate that Bible First Online is about 70% complete. There’s still much work to do, but once it’s finished, it will extend the reach of Bible First far beyond the conventional printed page.

We’ll be writing more about this project in future updates, but for now, please pray for our development team as we build this app. We are particularly grateful for programmers Trevor Brown and Andy Buck who are assisting us.

<strong>Almost Baby Time!</strong>
Oh, and there’s one more thing: it’s almost baby time! Kelsie is due to deliver our first son in early January. Please pray for our family–and Kelsie in particular–as we prepare to welcome our new little boy!

<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/steele-girls.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2071" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/steele-girls-338x450.jpg" alt="steele-girls" width="338" height="450" /></a>

<strong>How You Can Pray</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Praise God for the work being done to translate Bible First into various languages.</li>
  <li>Pray for Anatoliy, Catherine, and Maria as they translate. We are very grateful for their diligence and commitment to this ministry!</li>
  <li>Pray for Kelsie and the baby as we near the birth.</li>
  <li>Pray for my mom, Cathy. She flies to Ukraine on December 28th to help our family during the birth.</li>
  <li>Pray for Trevor, Andy and myself we continue the development of Bible First Online.</li>
  <li>Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine.</li>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Meet David Noble</h1>
[caption id="attachment_2080" align="aligncenter" width="584"]<a href="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/david-collage.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2080" src="http://www.OFReport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/david-collage-1024x504.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="287" /></a> David Noble Steele was born in L’viv, Ukraine, on January 16, 2017. As you may have guessed from the photos, we like this little guy a lot, and we can’t wait to introduce you![/caption]

"Joshua’s Kingdom of Little Girls.” This was the endearing title once bestowed upon our family by my former language teacher, Veronica. And not without good reason! A family who can boast a string of four lovely daughters in a row is sure to win many admiring smiles, as well as the occasional quip about the absence of boys. Ukrainians in particular seem partial to girls, often reassuring us that, “Girls are so much better. They’re quieter. They’ll take care of you when you’re older.”  Etcetera. “Still,” I would think to myself at times, “if God wanted to give me a son, I wouldn’t complain.”

I’ll never forget that day we went in for the ultrasound. When the technician told us we were having a boy, I must confess that my faith level was somewhere in between Sarah and Abraham. I didn’t laugh out loud in unbelief, but to say that I “staggered not” would be overly generous. Could it be true? Was God really going to give us a son?

Thereafter, at every ultrasound, I would always ask, “So we still think it’s going to be a boy?” Finally, a few weeks before the birth, we had one last ultrasound, and I asked my usual question. The doctor chuckled, looked at the monitor, then back at me, and with an emphatic smile declared, “No possible alternative!”

Finally, the day came for the birth. As Kelsie and I settled in to our room at the Ukrainian hospital here in L’viv, we prayed for a short labor, for safety for mother and baby, and for wisdom for the doctors. The contractions began around four in the afternoon, and David was born without incident a little before nine o’clock that evening.

One might think that after so many children, these new arrivals would lose their shine. But experience has proven that every child, boy and girl alike, is a reward from heaven, and their entrance into the family is cause for rejoicing which cannot be described in words.

<strong>David’s Name</strong>
Names are important to God, and in Scripture we find Him carefully selecting names based on their meaning. We have likewise tried to choose names for our children that will encourage them to aspire to follow Christ in bold ways.

In the Bible, <strong>David</strong> was not only the greatest king ever to rule Israel, but he had a heart for the Lord that was unparalleled. Even when chastened, he said things like,
<em>“... let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:” (1 Chronicles 21:13)</em>

The name <strong>Noble</strong> is a reference to the Bereans, of whom Paul said in Acts 17:11 that they <em>“...were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."</em> Thus nobility in this context is not a position of high birth or great material wealth, but a faithful tenacity in studying the Word of God.

It is our prayer for our son that even in his youth he will come to know and love the <em>heart of God</em> as he immerses himself in the study of the <em>Word of God</em>.

<strong>Good and Evil Update</strong>
God is richly blessing our work on the new Ukrainian translation of Good and Evil! Our translator, Anatoliy, has completed the first chapter, and Nathan and I have also completed our review of the text. Chapter 2 is in progress.

Meanwhile, we have been in touch with the same printer who did Good and Evil last time, back in 2008. His name is Oleksander, and he is a believer. Not only has he given us an outstanding quote for the new printing, but he has also volunteered his services to handle all of the graphics work free of charge.

Please continue to pray for this project. Good and Evil has proven itself an effective ministry tool in Ukraine, and we’re excited to make this new translation available in color. Much work remains, but God is moving and we’re encouraged!
